## zettlr_pr-BR_files
pt-BR files from LibreOffice for Brazillian Portuguese (pt-BR) craches Zettlr

These files were optimized for Zettlr capabilities by:
* Saving them for with UTF-8 char set encoding;
* Removing ênclises and mesóclises rules from .aff file.
 
So, it seems Latin-rooted languages are soo much refined for the German capabilities on language,LoL.

In the future, I wish to return ênclises and only keep mesóclises out since them are linguistic oldfashion for current language.

So, I wish you enjoy these files. You should install them on Zettlr config folder by following the usual procedure described on:
